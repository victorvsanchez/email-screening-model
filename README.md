# Email screening model

A fine-tuned Transformer model that uses LLMs to aid in the screening process of corporate e-mails. Based on the [BERTimbau](https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert) model, and customized with client data, this model is able to distinguish e-mails of 11 different categories, optimizing the screening process and allowing a faster redirecting of e-mails to the relevant team.
